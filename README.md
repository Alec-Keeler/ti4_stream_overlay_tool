Change-log
Update 1 (Mar 09, 2021):
    * Changed all fonts to 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif.
    * Now using shorthand faction names instead of full faction names.
    * Now using a shorter key and added two letter characters to the end of the key string.
    * Since the !gamedata command now defaults to 30 second updates, removed the '30' part of the TTS command string and associated instruction.
    * New Feature: Tech Overview component fully functional.

Update 2 (Mar 13, 2021):
    * Implemented a minor feature that crosses out used strategy cards on the scoreboard.
    * Fixed styling to prevent names/factions not being fully contained and visible on the scoreboard.
    * New Feature: Available Points component fully functional.
        Notes: To track Imperial Rider points, you MUST use the original action card to place owner token(s) on, return copies to the AC discard pile.
        Notes: If a law causes a secret to become a public objecive, it will still be tracked as a secret objective on the component, but will appear multiple times, once for each player who has scored it.
    
Update 3 (Mar 14, 2021)
    * Updated Available Points component to remove a point indicator if Political Censure is repealed.  It will also indicate that the law had been in play but was repealed.
    * The scoreboard now automatically updates names when players switch seats.
    * Added a new instruction to the front page instruction list indicating users should use Window Capture, not Browser sources on OBS.
